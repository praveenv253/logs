- message: 'If you have defined a variable in a header file and not declared it as
    const, like so: double e = 2.71; then the compiler will treat it as a separate
    variable in each translation unit. So if you link two such translation units together
    under the same object later, you will get a multiple definition error, or something
    like "already defined in...". To solve this issue, mark this variable as static
    const (in C), or as simply const (in C++, where static is implied for const variables).
    What this does is to make the linkage of this variable definition _internal_,
    meaning that once this definition gets #included into a .c or .cpp file, the definition
    stays there. It does not have scope outside of the translation unit, and thus
    cannot be seen by the other object files. On the other hand, the addresses of
    each of these "copies" of the constant in different translation units will be
    different. To have a "true" global constant this way, you will need to have an
    "extern const double e;" in your header file, followed by a "const double e =
    2.71;" in a separate source file, which is compiled into a separate object file,
    _which_ then gets linked with all the other objects. Courtesy of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2328671/constant-variables-not-working-in-header.'

- message: '"The implementation of a non-specialized template must be visible to a
    translation unit that uses it. The compiler must be able to see the implementation
    in order to generate code for all specializations in your code." What this essentially
    means is that you cannot define an external templated function in the typical
    way: have the template function declaration in the header, followed by an implementation
    of the template function in a C++ file, which then gets compiled into an object
    file, and later gets linked with the main program. This method does not work.
    Why? Because the compiler needs to "know" what the "full" definition of the function
    is (with actual classes of the templated types) in order to actually compile the
    program. A template function is simply a sort of shorthand for writing many functions
    of that do the same thing with different data types; but the compiler still needs
    to actually create "specializations" of this template for each type that actually
    gets used. That is the only way it can generate object code. Check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10632251/undefined-reference-to-template-function
    on ways to resolve this issue. One method involves putting the implementation
    in the header. The other method involves pre-defining the specializations.'

- message: To make a user-defined python module that you can import in many scripts,
    you must place your module in one of the site-packages directories in `sys.path`.
    If you are not using a virtual environment to run your programs in, then the correct
    place for this is `~/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/`. It was meant for exactly
    this purpose; see [PEP 370](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370/). If you
    are using a virtualenv, then you could simply create a symbolic link in the virtualenv
    site-packages directory to your module. Or you could install your module in `/usr/lib/python3.4`
    with sudo privileges (probably not a good idea though). There should be a way
    to get virtualenv to look in `~/.local` as well, but I have not yet figured this
    out.

    wonderful blog entry. Essentially, we need to manually map the escape sequences
    to the keywords `sitm` and `ritm`, which are used by vim to set and remove italic
    mode respectively. The file in question, `xterm-256color-italic.terminfo`, has
    been added to the `misc` repository as well. It contains all relevant install
    info. Note that `TERM` must be set to `xterm-256color-italic` by `gnome-terminal`
    for this to take effect. [This](http://askubuntu.com/questions/233280/gnome-terminal-reports-term-to-be-xterm)

    to be `env TERM=xterm-256color-italic /bin/bash`.

    hardcopy does not seem to use the correct syntax highlighting file. Or rather,
    it uses GUI settings, which means that unless your syntax highlighting file takes
    care of looking good on gvim, it will not give you a good result. For you to get
    syntax highlighting _at all_, you must first `:set term=xterm-256color-italic`
    even if it is already set. Do it even if `:set term` returns `xterm-256color-italic`.
    Then, to actually get _terminal colours_, use `:TOhtml`, which converts the file
    into an html page, which you can then print from your browser. For a good print
    colorscheme, run `:colorscheme print`, which is is a custom light-background colorscheme
    I made for printing. Do this before running `:TOhtml`, obviously.

- message: Sometimes, a python script just gives up and hangs. Even Ctrl-C does not
    exit the program. You do not have to have a loop with a catch-all `except` command
    or anything. Apparently, this can happen because of what is known as a "deadlock",
    which refers to some kind of race condition when running a threaded program. I
    was not running a threaded program, except I *was*, because I was using BLAS.
    In this case, OpenBLAS, which appears to have had a history with deadlocks, and
    maybe still does, or maybe it was due to my having accidentally installed numpy
    with MKL and scipy with OpenBLAS. In any event, the only reason I found out that
    the issue was with blas.py is thanks to [this excellent little piece of software](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hanging_threads/2.0.3),
    which shows you a stack trace if your program is inactive for more than 10 seconds.
    It is a python package called [`hanging_threads`](https://github.com/niccokunzmann/hanging_threads)
    and works like a charm. This invaluable tool was found after I finally figured
    out what to google for, and landed on [this SO page](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3443607/525169),
    and then scrolled down a lot after the top answer (`trace`) did not work for me.
    [`trace`](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/trace.html) is a python module and
    is also really useful. It prints out the commands currently being executed. This
    is really neat because if your program suddenly (and hopefully deterministically)
    gives up, you get a full history of all the commands executed. The `--ignore-dir`
    flag is extremely useful, since you can avoid printing out various internal modules.
    I was lucky, since my packages of interest (`sht`, `cross_validation`, etc.) were
    under `$HOME/.local`, so I could just supply `--ignore-dir=/usr` and prevent tracing
    through imports like `sys` and `numpy`.
